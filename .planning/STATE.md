## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Migration to Next.js (Pending): Need server-side API routes for Google Sheets integration (v2 scope)
- Supabase for auth + DB (Pending): Deferred to v2, v1 keeps mock localStorage auth
- Skip PWA for v1: Reduces scope, webapp is sufficient for event check-in
- Any QR triggers check-in: QR content validation deferred to future iteration
